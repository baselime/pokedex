# pokedex

A demo application to demonstrate Observability as Code (OaC).

Deployed to `https://a43hiiwt6d.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod`
## Intro

`pokedex` is a demo web application back-end, with a single endpoint `GET /pokemons`. It takes as path parameter the name of a pokemon and returns more details about the pokemon. The language defaults to english but you can use other language using the ?lang= query parameter. The options are en, jp, ch, and fr.

You can also list pokemon using the `GET /pokemons` endpoint without a path parameter

Finally you can search pokemons using lyra search at `GET /search?term=`, can you find the cold starts? Warning: the cold starts are Icey ðŸ§Š

However, the application will throw errors occasionally, based on a random number. This is used to demonstrate how to investigate issues using OaC and Baselime.
